Subject: [PATCH 11/24] Reduce number of symbols being exported from mysqld.exe

Due to the export limit (16-bit ordinal field in PE, max val = 2^16-1),
if the number of symbols required to be exported end up to be greater
than 65535, link.exe errors out with:
   LINK : fatal error LNK1189: library limit of 65535 objects exceeded

The number of symbols generated with create_def.cc for 8.0.26 are greater than
65535. This patch filters out the rapidjson and boost symbols since they are
from headers only and if the plugins require them, they are likely to include
them inside the DLL itself. The change brings down the count to approx. 65174,
which is < 65535.
